CMPUT 411  Assignment 3
-----------------------

Assignment 3 from the CMPUT 411 class at the University of Alberta

Assignment Description:
In this assignment you will implement an enhanced model viewer then a combined meshmotion
viewer (in C++/OpenGL). Your programs will first read in a description of a 3D
mesh model of a person, a 3D skeleton (which has been properly located inside the mesh),
and a set of attachment weights that connect the mesh to the skeleton.
I have already solved for the attachment weights using the method explained in class.
Your first program will simply add solid surfaces, lighting and textures to a mesh model
of a human figure to make the model appear successively realistic. Your second program will
then read a motion capture sequence and animate the mesh model using smooth deformation.
